***Before compliling the program***

## How to set up the item database ##
Our program takes in a .txt file as its database. The database contains all the different types of items the store is able to recognize. Every line of the .txt file contains csv (comma separated values) and should be formatted in the following way: 
>>> UPC,name,section,subsection,aisle number,bought price,sell price,quantity,threshold,supplier
For example, a line in the database could be: 
>>> 10000,broccoli,produce,vegetables,1,10,20,50,5,Metro
which denotes that broccoli has a UPC number of 10000 and its section is produce and its subsection is vegetables and is in aisle 1. They were bought at $10 and are sold at $20. 50 units are in store, and the threshold is 5. Its supplier is Metro.
There should not be any extra spaces before or after the commas. 

## How to set up Events.txt ##
Our Events.txt file uses a code-to-action system, which is defined in eventCodes.txt. For example, 1 means get name, 2 means get item, etc.

Every line is formatted in such a way that the first number means an action, the second and consequent numbers are data values. For example, a line could be: 
>>> 1,100001
which means "get the name of the item with UPC 100001".
We have included a file called "Events codes.txt" that has more information on how to properly format Events.txt.

***Compling the program***

Press run to complie the program. 
- The first time the user runs the program, the program will ask the user to enter a path to StoreItems.txt, which is the aforementioned database file. 
The program will then ask the user for a path to Events.txt. 

The program will run Events.txt line by line, storing the output in log.txt. 

When the program finishes running, it will save itself as Store.ser so that next time when it runs it won't have to set up the database again.
