## How to set up the item database ##
Our program takes in a .txt file as its database. The database contains all the different types of items the store is able to recognize. Every line of the .txt file contains csv (comma separated values) and should be formatted in the following way: 
>>> UPC,name,section,subsection,aisle number,bought price,sell price,quantity,threshold,supplier
For example, a line in the database could be: 
>>> 10000,broccoli,produce,vegetables,1,10,20,50,5,Metro
which denotes that broccoli has a UPC number of 10000 and its section is produce and its subsection is vegetables and is in aisle 1. They were bought at $10 and are sold at $20. 50 units are in store, and the threshold is 5. Its supplier is Metro.
There should not be any extra spaces before or after the commas.
